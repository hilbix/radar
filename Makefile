# Following is quite wrong, as it recompiles all *.o,
# not only the one for the individual target,
# and also it re-links everything needlessly in case a single *.o changes.
# (I can live with this flaw, as it is quite better than any workaround I was able to find.)
#
# My way ALWAYS looks like following:
#
# - each .c creates one .o and one .d (for auto-dependencies)
# - each .o creates one bin (THIS IS THE PROBLEMATIC PART)
# - everything else is handled with includes (handled by .d)
#
# I really have not the slightest idea how to formulate this for the current directory,
# as bins do not have extensions, as following does not work as expected:
#
#	%: $(TMPDIR)/%.o
#
# Note that creating the bin in .tmp/ or similar is bullshit.
